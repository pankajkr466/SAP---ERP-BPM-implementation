# SAP- ERP BPM implementation
This repository includes all the ERP and BPM assignments covered in our college course: ERP & BPM. We implemented various modules of ERP in SAP environment. We designed BPM processes in Microsoft Visio. We also implemented Material management in S/4 HANA environment. 

This course introduced business process management and reengineering in the key functional areas of todayâ€™s global businesses. We learned how to model business processes using BPMN notation. Course content included analysis and discussion of several business process improvement and ERP implementation cases, in order to build understanding of how BPM and ERP systems are deployed in organizations. The course employed SAP as the instance of an ERP system. We used SAP with a business case to understand both the configuration and use of an ERP as a tool for integration of business across functional units.
